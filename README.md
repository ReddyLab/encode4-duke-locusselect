### Controls for functional ENCODE
- [Download K562 selected histone modifications from ENCODE](download_chipseq_peaks_from_encode.k562.ipynb)
- [Download H1-hESC selected histone modifications from ENCODE](download_chipseq_peaks_from_encode.H1-hESC.ipynb)

We decided to download p-value signal files from combined replicates, binning the values in 250bp windows.
A single table with regions as rows and factors as columns with the mean values per window is produced.
